I am currently a master student at [Tsinghua NLP](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/) and an incoming Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst advised by Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/). I obtained my bachelor degree at [CST@THU](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/).

My research interest lies in large language models and cross-modality learning.
